## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### Full Stack Developer | DevOps Enthusiast | Eager to Learn and Grow
Equipped with expertise in JavaScript (React, Angular) in the frontend and Node.js in the backend, I bring a blend of frontend and backend proficiency to drive innovative solutions. My strong grasp of DevOps practices, including CI/CD, automation, and containerization, enables me to seamlessly bridge the gap between development and operations.

### Seeking Opportunities
As a recent bootcamp graduate, I am excited to embark on a career in full stack web development. I am actively seeking opportunities to contribute my skills and make a positive impact on real-world projects. I am open to internships, entry-level roles, and collaborative projects that foster growth and allow me to grow as a developer.
